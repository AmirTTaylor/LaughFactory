I want a program that tells basic dad jokes, it will have a file that holds a bunch of dad jokes found on the internet
and another with a program that will randomly tell the dad jokes. 

Jokes.txt : Holds Dad Jokes
Comedian.java : Ask if user would like to hear a joke, Sort jokes from joke file into arraylist, tell random joke from list

Access the joke file from comedian file File I/O Streams
