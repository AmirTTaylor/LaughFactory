I want a program that tells basic dad jokes, it will have a file that holds a bunch of dad jokes found on the internet
and another with a program that will randomly tell the dad jokes. 

Jokes.txt : Holds Dad Jokes
Comedian.java : Ask if user would like to hear a joke, Tell the joke from joke file

Access the joke file from comedian file File I/O Streams (Study dont look up)

randomize which joke is read, find out how to control the start line of .read() method
